âœ¨ Finally, after more than 20 days of hard work and countless hours each day, I have successfully completed my fifth data analytics project!
I am excited to share that this is the biggest dataset I have ever worked on â€” more than 1.7 million rows, covering 120 years (1900â€“2020) of renewable energy data from European countries. I took this dataset from @Kaggle, and I am proud to say that I completed this task very well.
Along the way, I explored and learned many new things:
Handling such a massive dataset for the very first time.
Loading data into Oracle MySQL and @Microsoft Power BI, since Excel couldnâ€™t manage this scale.
Using melt in Python Software Foundation to restructure the dataset into a cleaner, more manageable format.
Building a Python server to efficiently load big data into MySQL.
Performing operations like Excelâ€™s Text to Columns, but automated with Python.
Connecting MySQL with Power BI to analyze and visualize the cleaned data.
This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also boosted my confidence in handling large-scale datasets and end-to-end data analytics workflows. ðŸš€
