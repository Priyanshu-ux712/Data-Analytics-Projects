ðŸŽ¯ Bringing Real-World Data to Life: Awareness, Behavior & Impact!
In my latest project, I analyzed a global public health dataset to understand how government campaigns and sex education programs impact:
ðŸ“ˆ Contraceptive Usage
 ðŸ“‰ Teen Pregnancy Rates
 ðŸ§  Public Awareness
 ðŸ›’ Online Purchase Behavior
Using Power BI + SQL + Excel, I explored how awareness initiatives affect real behavior across countries and time:
ðŸ”¹ Built views in MySQL for grouped insights
 ðŸ”¹ Cleaned data using Excel functions like Text to Columns
 ðŸ”¹ Designed Power BI dashboards with comparisons like:
 â€¢ With vs Without Campaigns
 â€¢ Gender Purchase Shifts
 â€¢ Awareness Index Trends
ðŸ’¡ Surprising Insight: In countries with strong campaigns, teen pregnancy rates drop, and online sales go up â€” even if overall sales donâ€™t always reflect it at first glance.
This project helped me sharpen my real-world data thinking â€” going beyond numbers into behavioral patterns.
ðŸ’¬ Would love to hear your thoughts or feedback.
